          <p>Currently I am employed as a Staff Accountant in the Hospitality Industry.<br />
            I gained my degree in 2013 when I graduated from the University of Colorado in Denver.<br /> 
            My degree is in Business Administration with an emphasis in Accounting. <br />
            I enjoy accounting but would like to gain a new skillset in being a Full Stack Web Developer.<br />
            Ever since the days of Myspace I have been interested in styling and producing code for websites.<br />
            I have been a resident of Colorado for 21 years and have I loved every moment of it.</p>

            <p>My favorite thing to do is to go on walks with my husband, Matt, and my cat, Giannis. <br />
            Giannis is my 1<sup>st</sup> pet. So far it has been a really great experience. <br />
            Some of my favorite things to do are gaming, swimming, and being outdoors. <br />
            When I was younger I was employed as a lifeguard for 8 years.I am the eldest of three.</p>
